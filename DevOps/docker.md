# Docker Learning Guide for Java Backend Developers

## Essential Level (Must Know)

### 1. Docker Fundamentals
- **What is Docker and containerization**
  - Difference between containers and virtual machines
  - Benefits of containerization for Java applications
  - Docker architecture (Docker Engine, Images, Containers)

### 2. Docker Images
- **Understanding Docker Images**
  - Image layers and layer caching
  - Base images (official Java images: openjdk, adoptopenjdk)
  - Image tagging and versioning
- **Working with Images**
  - `docker pull`, `docker images`, `docker rmi`
  - Image inspection with `docker inspect`

### 3. Dockerfile Creation
- **Dockerfile Basics**
  - FROM, COPY, ADD, RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT
  - WORKDIR, EXPOSE, ENV, ARG
- **Java-Specific Dockerfile Patterns**
  - Multi-stage builds for Maven/Gradle projects
  - Optimizing layer caching for dependencies
  - JVM tuning in containers (heap size, GC settings)
- **Best Practices**
  - Using .dockerignore
  - Minimizing image size
  - Security considerations (non-root users)

### 4. Container Management
- **Basic Container Operations**
  - `docker run`, `docker start`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`
  - Container naming and port mapping
  - Environment variables and configuration
- **Container Interaction**
  - `docker exec` for debugging
  - `docker logs` for troubleshooting
  - `docker cp` for file operations

### 5. Docker Networking
- **Network Basics**
  - Default bridge network
  - Port publishing (-p flag)
  - Container-to-container communication
- **Custom Networks**
  - Creating and managing custom networks
  - Service discovery by container name

### 6. Data Management
- **Volumes and Bind Mounts**
  - Persistent data storage
  - Volume mounting for development
  - Database data persistence
- **Volume Management**
  - Named volumes vs anonymous volumes
  - Volume inspection and cleanup

## Intermediate Level (Should Know)

### 7. Docker Compose
- **Multi-Container Applications**
  - docker-compose.yml structure
  - Services, networks, and volumes definition
  - Environment-specific configurations
- **Development Workflows**
  - Local development with compose
  - Database integration (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
  - Service dependencies and startup order

### 8. Advanced Dockerfile Techniques
- **Multi-Stage Builds**
  - Separating build and runtime environments
  - Copying artifacts between stages
- **Build Optimization**
  - Dependency caching strategies
  - Using build contexts effectively
  - Build arguments and environment handling

### 9. Image Registry and Distribution
- **Docker Hub and Private Registries**
  - Pushing and pulling images
  - Image tagging strategies
  - Registry authentication
- **Image Security**
  - Vulnerability scanning
  - Image signing and verification

### 10. Monitoring and Debugging
- **Container Health Checks**
  - HEALTHCHECK instruction
  - Health check endpoints for Spring Boot
- **Resource Management**
  - Memory and CPU limits
  - Resource monitoring with `docker stats`

## Advanced Level (Nice to Have)

### 11. Production Considerations
- **Security Hardening**
  - Running as non-root user
  - Read-only file systems
  - Secrets management
- **Performance Optimization**
  - JVM container awareness
  - Memory and CPU tuning
  - Image size optimization

### 12. CI/CD Integration
- **Build Automation**
  - Docker in CI/CD pipelines
  - Automated testing in containers
  - Image building and publishing

### 13. Advanced Networking
- **Custom Network Drivers**
  - Overlay networks
  - Network policies and security
- **Service Mesh Integration**
  - Preparing containers for service mesh deployment

## Practical Skills to Develop

### 1. Common Java Application Patterns
- Containerizing Spring Boot applications
- Database migration containers
- Background job processors
- Microservices communication

### 2. Development Workflow
- Hot reload development setup
- Debugging containerized applications
- Integration testing with testcontainers

### 3. Troubleshooting Skills
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance profiling in containers
- Memory leak detection
- Network connectivity issues

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Week 1-2**: Docker fundamentals, basic Dockerfile creation
2. **Week 3-4**: Container management, networking, and data persistence
3. **Week 5-6**: Docker Compose and multi-container applications
4. **Week 7-8**: Advanced Dockerfile techniques and optimization
5. **Week 9-10**: Production considerations and CI/CD integration

## Essential Commands to Master

```bash
# Image operations
docker build -t myapp:latest .
docker pull openjdk:11-jre-slim
docker images
docker rmi image_id

# Container operations
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name myapp myapp:latest
docker exec -it myapp /bin/bash
docker logs -f myapp
docker stop myapp
docker rm myapp

# Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down
docker-compose logs -f service_name
docker-compose exec service_name /bin/bash

# Cleanup
docker system prune
docker volume prune
docker network prune
```

## Project-Based Learning
- Containerize a simple Spring Boot REST API
- Set up a multi-service application with database
- Create a development environment with Docker Compose
- Build and deploy to a container registry
- Implement health checks and monitoring
