Subject - You Might be the reason I landed in Amazon 


Hi [Name],

Hope you’re doing well!

Just wanted to follow up on my previous message. Since then, I’ve continued building more backend projects and gone deeper into Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot. I’m also staying consistent with DSA on LeetCode.

I’d really appreciate any direction you could share on how I can improve my chances of getting into product-based companies like LinkedIn or Amazon, especially considering I’m still on bench at Genpact.

Would love to hear your thoughts whenever you get a moment — your advice would mean a lot!

Best regards,
Suraj Singh
